# Kafka Setup

In development environments, you can use kafka with most OOB defaults.

``` 
# this will install java, zookeeper, and kafka
brew install kafka

# Starting ZK and Kafka as services

brew services start zookeeper
brew services start kafka

brew services stop kafka
brew services stop zookeeper

```

After installing Kafka via Homebrew, following helpful info is output:

``` 
 ==> zookeeper
To have launchd start zookeeper now and restart at login:
  brew services start zookeeper
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
