/**
 * The Transaction Processor.
 *
 * <p>
 *     The Transaction Processor is at the heart of the platform and has the responsibility of processing inbound user
 *     transactions. The transactions could be related to any business functionality, like sending airtime or reloading
 *     money into your own account. Business operations that are ideally suited to be routed to the transaction processor
 *     are those that are potentially expensive and have strict guarantees to fulfill. Also, such operations may be retried
 *     e.g. a airtime send operation may be retried.
 *
 *     The transaction processor listens to transaction requests that are processed to Kafka. Part of the objective here
 *     is to scale the transaction processing horizontally. Kafka listeners(and the transaction processing is one) can
 *     for consumer groups. Essentially, when the transaction processor is deployed for example to a Kubernetes cluster,
 *     one could scale very easily by increasing/decreasing the number of replicas.
 *
 *     All the other production grade features of Kafka are available by default to the transaction processor.
 * </p>
