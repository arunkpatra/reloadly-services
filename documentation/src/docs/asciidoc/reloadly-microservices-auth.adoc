=== Authentication Microservice

The Authentication service allows multiple enterprise facilities like:

* User signup : Currently username and password based login is supported. This can be extended to other auth channels. Users are issued JWT tokens.
* Token Verification : JWT tokens are verified at the authentication service.
* API Key verification and issue : API keys are issued to users and service accounts.
* All other microservices call into the Auth Service to validate tokens and API keys. It is a foundational service.

==== API
See Swagger UI for API documentation. It's available at http://localhost:9090/swagger-ui/ when you run your services locally.
