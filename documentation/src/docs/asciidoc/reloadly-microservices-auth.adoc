=== Authentication Microservice

The Authentication service allows multiple enterprise facilities like:

* User signup - Currently username and password based login is supported.
Can be extended to other auth channels.
Users are issued JWT tokens.
* Signup - Users can signup by choosing a username and password.
* Token Verification - Verify JWT tokens.
* API Key verification and issue functions.
API keys are issued to users and service accounts.
* All other microservices call into the Auth Service to validate tokens and API keys.
It is a foundational service.

See Swagger UI for API documentation.
It's available at http://localhost:9090/swagger-ui/ when you run your services locally.
