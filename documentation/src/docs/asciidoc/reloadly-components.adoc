== Reloadly Modules

Foundational modules are reusable pieces of software that can be easily integrated into other modules.
The following modules are used in the rest of the platform.
Note that, in a Microservices architecture, individual microservices should share reusable code only if it makes sense and if sharable code is well managed by a team which keeps pace with others.
